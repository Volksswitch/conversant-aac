# AI-Enabled AAC — Project Context for Claude

## About Ken (the user)
Ken Hackbarth is President and Founder of Volksswitch.org. He has a three-decade background as a systems engineer at AT&T Bell Laboratories. He is **not** a developer or AI/AAC researcher — he is a product manager and systems thinker. He defines requirements, makes feature decisions, and recruits beta testers. Claude Code is the developer.

Published author: "Revolutionizing Augmentative and Alternative Communication with Generative Artificial Intelligence," ATOB Volume 18, Spring 2024 (pp. 100–123). This paper is the foundational vision document for this project and is stored as `ATOB_V18_Hackbarth.pdf` in this folder.

## Project Vision
Build an AI-enabled AAC system that gives non-speaking individuals access to **real-time conversation** — currently impossible with existing AAC devices. The core problem is not words-per-minute; it is the human aversion to awkward silence (~4 seconds). AAC users are locked into near-real-time or batch communication, which marginalizes them and restricts them to transactional rather than interactional communication.

**Mechanism:** Generative AI presents response options within seconds of a communication partner's utterance. The user selects one; the device speaks it. The system speaks *as* the user, not *for* them.

---

## Target User (Initial)
Literate, non-speaking individual with cerebral palsy (CP), 16+, using **direct select** (touch/pointer) as the access method. Vision is to expand to wider range of ages, literacy levels, and accessibility profiles over time.

---

## Architecture Components (from the paper)
1. **Situational Awareness** — GPS, face/voice recognition, calendar
2. **NLP In** — Speech-to-text
3. **Statement/Response Generation** — LLM (the linchpin)
4. **Statement/Response Shaping/Tuning** — worldview model, relationship modeling, conversation history
5. **NLP Out** — Text-to-speech

---

## Build Decisions (confirmed)

**Platform:** Static web app served from GitHub Pages (or similar). User points browser at a URL. App runs entirely in-browser. No backend server.

**Target hardware:** The File System Access API (FSA) is not supported on iOS or Android, and Apple does not make a tablet-class Mac. Therefore the device must be a Windows tablet running Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome. The Microsoft Surface is the primary candidate.

**Local data storage:** File System Access API — the app is granted permission to read/write a local folder on the user's machine. All worldview data, conversation history, and profile data stays on-device. No data sent to any server except the LLM API.

**Cross-device transfer:** Later feature — user manually exports a data package and moves it via iCloud, Google Drive, or OneDrive.

**AI vendor:** Claude API (Anthropic) first. Multi-vendor support added later. User creates their own Anthropic account and supplies their own API key. The Claude API is pay-as-you-go, billed per token — there is **no ongoing free tier for API access** (the free tier on the consumer claude.ai app does not apply to the developer API). The user pays only for the conversations they actually have. API key stored locally.

**Speech-to-text transcript validation:** Displaying the transcript of what the partner said is **critical** — not optional. The user must be able to confirm the system heard correctly before selecting a response.

**End-of-utterance detection (continuous partner capture):** A silence period (the "Optional Responses silence period" setting) is a *checkpoint, not a stop*. Each time the partner pauses for that period, the speech collected so far is sent to the AI for response options and a placeholder is spoken; recording continues. Resumed speech is appended and the combined utterance is re-sent after the next pause, so each checkpoint yields a more complete option set. Recording stops only when the user selects a response, at which point the transcript is cleaned once and the exchange is stored. A "latest-wins" generation token discards superseded in-flight requests, and a persistent "Please repeat what you said." control discards a garbled capture and keeps listening. An **auto-resume-listening** setting (Settings → General; default **off**) turns partner recording back on automatically after a response is spoken, so the user need not tap Start Listening between exchanges. (Implemented June 2026; see `Continuous-Partner-Capture.docx` and Architecture Overview §9. This is the Phase 1 realization of the COMPLETE/INCOMPLETE/CONTINUING classifier and filler ladder above.)

**Voice/TTS:** Browser built-in TTS acceptable for MVP. Voice banking (personalized/cloned voice) is a valuable future feature.

**Communication partner:** Needs nothing. Entirely unaware of system internals. AR glasses are a future hardware form factor.

---

## Response Option Display

Response options shown to the user may appear in **compressed form** — a few words representing a fuller thought — to speed up reading. The system may also read the compressed hint aloud. The **trigger for the auditory hint is a user preference**: options include auto-playback as each option is highlighted in sequence, or on first tap (before a double-tap confirms selection). Additional triggers may be supported based on user feedback.

The user normally hears the **fully expanded response only when it is spoken** after selection. Whether the expanded text is displayed or read before confirmation may become a configurable option based on user feedback.

Position 1 in the options list is the AI's best guess. There is no special visual treatment to distinguish it — the design goal is simply that the first option is the best option, with that accuracy improving over time.

---

## Worldview Model
- Minimum viable version: a carefully selected "getting to know you" questionnaire (~100 questions)
- Questions are completed entirely at the user's own pace; none are required
- The system provides meaningful functionality even with zero worldview questions answered
- Info gathering must be **chunked** — physically draining for CP users
- Many real-time exchanges need zero worldview context ("Hi, how are you?" needs no personalization)
- RAG will reduce token overhead as the profile grows over time
- Designing the specific questionnaire content is part of the work ahead

---

## Rollout Sequence

**Phase 1 — Core Conversation Loop (Proof of Concept)**
STT → display transcript → placeholder utterance auto-spoken → LLM generates response options → user selects → TTS speaks full response. No worldview shaping, no situational awareness.

Key Phase 1 features:
- **3 response options** by default (configurable)
- **Conversation context:** rolling window of the current session only
- **Placeholder/filler utterances** (e.g., "Just a second…", "Let me think about that") automatically generated and spoken while the user is selecting; customization supported
- **Conversation initiation:** via a set of canned conversation starters (pre-configured phrases the user can select to open a conversation); later refined by situational awareness in Phase 2
- **Compressed display / expanded speech** for response options (see above)
- **Minimal identity seed (name + "About You"):** Settings → General has a **Your Name** field and an optional short **About You** free-text field. These are injected into the response-generation system prompt so the assistant speaks *as* the user (first person) and can answer with the real name instead of emitting a `[Name]` placeholder. Even with both blank, the prompt forbids bracketed placeholders like `[Name]`/`[city]` and tells the model to phrase around any unknown detail. This is the smallest precursor to the Phase 3 worldview model, not a replacement for it. Stored locally in `aac_settings`; sent to the Claude API only as part of generating responses. (Implemented June 2026.)
- **Offline review/feedback mode:** deferred — too complex even in rudimentary form
- **Response option UI layout:** requires a design discussion on how much of the screen is allocated to traditional AAC vocabulary vs. AI-facilitated response options; ultimately user-configurable

**Phase 2 — Situational Awareness**
Add location context (GPS), communication partner recognition (face/voice), and calendar integration. Canned conversation starters become contextually suggested based on location and partner identity.

**Phase 3 — Worldview Shaping and Tuning**
Integrate the worldview model. Responses shaped to reflect the individual user's personality and goals. RAG employed to manage profile size. Offline feedback/review mode introduced here.

---

## Advanced Future Capability: Streaming Response Generation
The long-term vision is for the system to begin generating and refining response options *while the communication partner is still speaking* — using partial STT transcripts as they arrive. Options would be continuously updated and narrowed as the utterance becomes clearer. This eliminates virtually all post-utterance latency. This capability requires significant design thought and is not targeted for Phase 1 or 2.

---

## Strategic Context
Prior attempts at AI-enabled AAC have been shelved when funding ran out. Ken's architecture avoids this by:
- **No server infrastructure** the project must pay for
- **User-funded AI** — users bring their own API key, pay only for what they use

Ken has screenshots of and has presented live demos of a prior team's shelved product. The goal is to share this architecture with those developers as a more sustainable path forward.

**First deliverable:** A high-level architecture document suitable for sharing with those prior developers — not code.

---

## Conversation Analysis Design Layer (June 2026)

Ken collected Conversation Analysis (CA) literature and had it synthesized into `CA-Concepts-for-AAC-Architecture.docx` (on Ken's Desktop). Three design documents in this folder map those concepts to the system. **All project decisions are recorded here in CLAUDE.md** (Ken's preference — this folder syncs across machines; Claude's machine-local memory does not).

**Documents** (all Word, styled like Ken's papers — Arial, "Volksswitch.org | June 2026 | For internal use" footer; figures `ui-fig1..7.png` alongside, generated with Python/Pillow, regenerable on request):
1. `Conversation-Engine-Design.docx` — CA concepts → programmatic flow
2. `UI-Design.docx` — presentation layer and dynamic UI
3. `Configuration-Model.docx` — user-owned settings registry and experimentation loop

### Settled decisions — Conversation Engine

- **Sequence stack, not turn alternation**: conversation state is a stack of open sequences (adjacency pairs); repair sequences nest on top; the original obligation is restored automatically when they resolve.
- **Four-slot move palette**: PREFERRED / DISPREFERRED (hedge + account) / INITIATIVE / REPAIR — structurally distinct conversational moves, positionally stable for motor automaticity. (Refines the earlier "3 response options" default: the palette is typed by move, not just counted; option count remains configurable.)
- **Five modes**: LISTENING, RESPONDING, REPAIR-OF-SELF, INITIATING, PRE-CLOSING/CLOSING.
- **Access method independent of conversation logic**: engine emits a typed, prioritized palette descriptor; renderers (direct select now; scanning/eye gaze later) present it. Consistent with the direct-select initial target while keeping the expansion path clean.
- **System infers mode, user overrides** via persistent buttons (default set: Say again / Hold on / Pardon? / Wind down).
- **Single combined LLM call** classifies the partner's action (FPP type) AND generates options; classification is emitted first in structured output so it is inspectable. LLM stateless; app injects state.
- **Filler ladder** (refines the placeholder mechanism and the old 4 s initial delay): rung 1 acknowledgment token ≤1 s after end-of-utterance (no LLM — this is what makes transcript validation affordable), rung 2 projection filler ~2.5 s covering the confirm window, rung 3 periodic re-fill. CA: silence becomes meaningful past ~1 s.
- **Backchannels/continuers deferred**; end-of-utterance classification schema reserves COMPLETE | INCOMPLETE | CONTINUING so they slot in later without rework.
- **Highest-leverage near-term item**: REPAIR-OF-SELF mode — partner says "What?" → re-speak / rephrase / expand the user's last utterance.

### Settled decisions — UI

- Four screen regions: transcript (with mode chip), move palette, persistent controls, composer access. Geometry never reflows on mode change — "the cards changed," never "the screen changed."
- Move card anatomy: glanceable hint (primary reading target; names the action, not a truncation), full TTS text, slot badge, format tag, latency dot (filled = instant, hollow = generation round-trip).
- **Triple coding**: slot identity = position + color + text badge; never color alone. Defaults: green preferred, amber dispreferred, blue initiative, purple repair.
- Transcript is a three-state gate: amber UNCONFIRMED → blue CONFIRMED·GENERATING → green OPTIONS READY. Options are never generated from an unconfirmed transcript (default; auto-confirm above a confidence threshold is configurable).
- **Nothing is spoken on the user's behalf invisibly** — every filler/token is displayed as it plays.
- **Palette updates queue until a selection boundary**: options never change under a user mid-selection (mandatory for future scanning/dwell renderers).
- Engine→UI contract is a versioned palette-descriptor JSON with `priority` and `droppable` per move; renderers drop/page by priority, never by move type.

### Configurability philosophy (overarching)

- **As many decisions as possible are user-determined and configurable.** This population is made up of unique individuals; the user experiments with a flow and adjusts from experience. Behavioral statements in the design docs are *defaults of the standard profile*, not rules.
- **Invariants are guaranteed capabilities, not fixed behaviors**: a repair path, a floor-holding path, a closing path, free composition, visibility of system speech, and revertibility must always exist; how they manifest is configurable. Config validation enforces "at least one path" rules at save time, with explanation — never silent correction.
- Three settings tiers by *when* a change is safe — Quick (mid-conversation) / Profile (between conversations) / Setup (rare, may be supporter-assisted) — all user-owned; nothing locked away from the user.
- Experimentation loop: named profiles (bindable to Practice Mode scenarios), automatic change journal, session review metrics (descriptive, local, private — inform the user, never score them), guided trials, one-tap revert. Revertibility is the one absolute.

## Worldview Questionnaire (June 2026) — Build Step 1 DONE; UI (Step 2) is next

The worldview model (Architecture Overview §6) has a concrete questionnaire design, a build-ready implementation plan, and **Build Step 1 (data model + registry) is now implemented and verified** (June 14 2026).

**Build Step 1 — shipped (not yet committed; awaiting Ken's go):**
- `app/data/worldview-questions.json` — static registry. Scope per resolved decisions: **full Tier-A** (A1 About You, A2 Where You Are, A3 People, A4 Daily Life, A5 Contact) + **Tier-C starter** (C1 Favorites, C2 Passions). Each field: `key`, `q`, `type` (text/number/choice/multi/repeat), `options`, `fills` (placeholder synonyms), `sensitive`, `defaultPrivacy`. A5 fields are `defaultPrivacy: private`.
- `app/js/worldview.js` — model layer: `loadRegistry()`, `load()`/save (data-folder `worldview.json` write-through + localStorage cache), `getField`/`setField`/`declineField`/`resetField`/`resetAll`, three states (unanswered=key absent / answered / declined=sticky), `effectivePrivacy`/`setPrivacy`, gaps `recordGaps`/`listGaps`/`clearGaps`, `getModules` (progress), `suggestedNext` (gaps-first), and `buildBlock()` (compact profile text; labels from `fills[0]`; declined + private fields surface only as a phrase-around instruction, never with their values).
- `app/sw.js` — precache list updated (worldview.js + registry), CACHE_VERSION → `aac-v0.2.1`.
- **Verified in preview:** set/decline/reset/un-decline state transitions; cache round-trip; `buildBlock()` includes shareable facts and withholds private (phone) values while listing age+phone as phrase-around; gaps add/bump/drop-answered/clear; suggested-next ordering. *Caveat:* verification exercised the in-memory + localStorage-cache path; the on-disk FSA `worldview.json` write goes through the same `storage.writeFile` that conversation logging already uses, but confirming an actual on-disk file requires a user-granted data folder (FSA needs a user gesture).
- **Not touched:** the interim Name/About You Settings fields (they stay until Build Step 4), per guardrail.

**Remaining build order:** 2) questionnaire UI (`worldview-ui.js` — render/answer/own-words/decline/skip/edit/restart, module progress, suggested-next) → 3) LLM integration (structured `{options, missing_facts}`, inject `buildBlock()`, record gaps) → 4) migrate + remove Name/About You → 5) expand Tier-B + rest of Tier-C → 6) RAG-lite.

**Build Step 2 design intent — "Speak my answer" control (Ken, June 14 2026).** The questionnaire UI must include an on-demand **"speak my answer"** control during worldview collection, rendered **in-flow and close at hand** next to each answer — explicitly **not** in the Settings panel. Speaking an answer is opt-in/on-demand, never the automatic behavior that selecting a conversation *response* has. Rationale (scenarios that make spoken answers useful during collection): supporter-assisted entry (speech is the user's channel to the human helping); auditory proofread of free-text / "in my own words" answers; voice-match calibration (esp. B8 "Your Voice, in Your Words" — judge "does this sound like me?"); and doing the "getting to know you" session as a real conversation with another person. An **auto-speak toggle** (for the supporter-assisted and conversation-as-collection scenarios) is a reasonable later addition, but the always-available per-answer control is the requirement.

**Origin:** The interim *Your Name / About You* fields in Settings (shipped June 2026 to stop the LLM emitting `[Name]` placeholders) are a stopgap. The worldview questionnaire replaces and generalizes them. Bracketed placeholders are the signal of which personal facts conversations demand; the design turns that signal into a self-populating profile.

**Documents produced (in this folder, styled like the other design docs):**
1. `Worldview-Questionnaire-Draft1.docx` — the question bank. Three tiers: **A** Concrete Core (identity, place, people, daily life, contact), **C** Interests/Passions/Preferences (the layer the frameworks miss — Ken's explicit add), **B** Abstract Characteristics (personality via Big Five, values via Schwartz Portrait format, humor, register/style, beliefs, how-you-treat-different-people, emotional landscape, voice-in-your-words). Grounded in Big Five, Schwartz basic human values, and the AAC Communication Passport / "All About Me" tradition.
2. `Worldview-Implementation-Plan.docx` — build-ready plan. Slots into the Architecture Overview as **§17** (or expands §6). Covers data model, files, the gaps-log mechanism, conversation integration, UI flow, migration, build order, verification, and decisions-to-confirm.

**Settled design decisions:**
- **Three tiers** A (concrete, fills placeholders) / C (interests) / B (abstract, shapes voice). Abstract questions organized by *conversational lever* (what they change in output), not psychological taxonomy. Values use Schwartz **Portrait** format ("here's a person — how like you?").
- **Three field states:** Unanswered (eligible to ask/resurface) / Answered / **Declined** (sticky — never ask again, always phrase around; un-declinable). Skip ≠ Decline. Every question optional; full value at zero answers; chunked sessions.
- **Gaps-log mechanism:** the no-bracket / phrase-around rule stays, so gaps can't be read off the output. Instead the single combined generation call returns structured `{classification, options, missing_facts}`; `missing_facts` (normalized field keys) feed a gaps log that drives the questionnaire's "suggested next." Regex-on-output is only a fallback. This is **progressive profiling** — the questionnaire fills itself from real conversations.
- **Storage:** user-owned → `worldview.json` in the FSA data folder (localStorage cache), plus static `app/data/worldview-questions.json` registry. Contact info (A5) and beliefs (B5) **private by default** (never volunteered; phrase-around).
- **Sequencing guardrail:** keep the Name/About You Settings fields live until the questionnaire UI ships, then migrate legacy `userName`/`userAbout` into `worldview.json` and remove them. Do NOT remove early — it would regress the live app.

**Build order (from the plan doc):** 1) data model + registry → 2) questionnaire UI → 3) LLM integration (structured `missing_facts`, profile block, gaps recording) → 4) migrate + remove Name/About You → 5) expand Tier-B/Tier-C content → 6) RAG-lite.

**Token budget / RAG timing (plan doc §6):** We are *not* close to needing a RAG database. The questionnaire profile is bounded (~1–3K tokens fully answered = 0.1–0.3% of Sonnet 4.6's 1M context; ~a penny per conversation with prompt caching). RAG is driven by *unbounded cross-session memory* (Phase 3), not the structured fields — rough trigger is an always-relevant slice exceeding ~10–20K tokens. `buildBlock()` ships as simple heuristic selection (always-include core + topical facts on-topic; many turns need none); progression is heuristic → client-side embeddings (IndexedDB) → server-side vector store, the last only if cross-session memory becomes a headline feature (awkward in a no-backend app).

**Decisions resolved (Ken, June 14 2026) — these scope Build Step 1:**
1. **First-cut Tier-A set: FULL.** Author all Concrete-Core fields from the question bank now (not a smaller starter). Plus a starter of Tier-C interests (per build order).
2. **Contact info (A5): STRICT phrase-around for now.** Stored but never volunteered or shared in output. *Note / TODO:* add a per-field "assistant may share if I pick it" sharing control in a later build.
3. **Chunk size: NO FIXED CHUNK.** No enforced per-session stopping point; user answers as many or as few as they like each sitting. (The "suggested next" from the gaps log still guides ordering.)
4. **Tier-B beliefs (B5): DEFERRED** to a later build.
5. **Symbol/picture answers + supporter-assisted mode: LATER.** Build Step 1 supports typed/selected text answers only.

Also decided this session: the **type-and-speak composer** ("In My Own Words", § "Free Composition + Virtual Keyboard") is built alongside Build Step 1 as the manual worldview test pathway. See that section.

**Next-session kickoff prompt:**
> We're continuing the AI-Enabled AAC worldview questionnaire work. Read the "Worldview Questionnaire (June 2026)" section of CLAUDE.md and the two design docs in this folder: `Worldview-Questionnaire-Draft1.docx` (question bank) and `Worldview-Implementation-Plan.docx` (build-ready plan). Two phases this session.
>
> **Phase 1 — Resolve the open decisions first, with me.** Plan doc §11 lists five decisions to confirm before building: (1) size of the first-cut Tier-A set (full vs. smaller starter); (2) contact info (A5) — per-field "assistant may share if I pick it" toggle vs. strict phrase-around for now; (3) target chunk size (questions per session); (4) whether Tier-B beliefs (B5) ships in this build or waits; (5) symbol/picture answers + supporter-assisted mode now or later. Use AskUserQuestion, recommend a default for each, and record my answers in this CLAUDE.md section.
>
> **Phase 2 — Build Step 1: data model + question registry** (plan §2–3). Create `app/data/worldview-questions.json` — the static registry (modules → fields with key, question text, type, answer options, placeholder synonyms `fills`, `sensitive`, `defaultPrivacy`, follow-ups), authored from the question-bank doc, scoped to whatever first-cut set we agreed in Phase 1 (Tier-A core + a starter of Tier-C interests at minimum). Create `app/js/worldview.js` — load/save `worldview.json` to the FSA data folder (follow `storage.js` patterns) with a localStorage cache; get/set/decline/reset fields; the three field states (unanswered = key absent / answered / declined = sticky); gaps add/list/clear; and `buildBlock()` returning the compact profile text for LLM injection (simple heuristic selection, no vector store — plan §6).
>
> Guardrails: do NOT touch the interim Name/About You Settings fields (they stay until Build Step 4). Honor declined/private at buildBlock time (never volunteer; phrase around). Gaps come from structured `missing_facts` in the generation response, not regex (plan §4) — that wiring is Build Step 3; for now just build the gaps add/list/clear API. Verify in the preview that worldview.js round-trips `worldview.json` through the data folder (set/decline/reset, buildBlock output, gaps add/list) before stopping. No commit or deploy unless I ask.

## "In My Own Words" — Free Composition + Virtual Keyboard (June 2026) — decided, not yet built

Free composition is one of the **invariants** (Configuration Model): the user must always have a path to type/compose something the AI did not generate and have the app speak it in the selected voice. The UI's **composer-access region** (UI-Design.docx four-region layout) is where this lives. "In my own words" is the user-facing name for that path.

**Why this surfaced now:** to test the worldview Tier model (and any response shaping) by hand before the AI generation path exercises it, we need a manual way to compose an utterance and speak it. So the simple composer is no longer just a far-future nicety — it's the **test harness for worldview output** and is wanted alongside Build Step 1.

### Settled decisions

- **The keyboard is the easy part; voice + return-to-UI are essentially free.** Any keyboard (OS or in-app) just deposits text into a focused field in the page. The app then speaks it via the existing `tts.speak()` path (already uses the app-selected voice), and the app UI was never actually left. No integration risk on the "speak in the app's voice" / "return to the app" requirements regardless of keyboard choice.

- **OS / browser keyboard cannot be reliably summoned, and is a black box — so it is a *fallback*, not the foundation.** Technical reality on a Windows tablet (Edge/Chrome):
  - There is **no web API to programmatically launch the Windows touch keyboard.** It auto-appears only when an editable element (`input`/`textarea`/`contenteditable`) receives focus *and* the device is in a touch context. "Invoke from a button" therefore means "focus a text field and hope the OS pops the keyboard."
  - On a Surface with the type cover attached (laptop mode) it often won't auto-pop at all. Behavior varies by tablet mode, Windows version, and browser.
  - The Chromium **VirtualKeyboard API** (`navigator.virtualKeyboard.show()`) only manages an already-available keyboard's overlay; it still requires focus on an editable element. Not a reliable on-demand "open system keyboard" switch.
  - It gives **zero control** over layout, key size, spacing, prediction, or access method — exactly the things that matter for a CP user's motor accessibility.

- **The real path is an in-app virtual keyboard.** It is the only option that:
  1. **Honors access-method independence** (engine emits a palette descriptor; renderers present it — direct select now, scanning / eye-gaze later). An OS keyboard can't participate in the future scanning renderer; an in-app keyboard *is* just another renderer.
  2. **Unlocks AI-assisted composition** — type a few words → expand into a full sentence *in the user's voice* (worldview model); personalized word/phrase prediction. The OS keyboard can touch none of this.
  3. Keeps visual + behavioral consistency (key sizing, triple-coding, dark mode, latency dots).

### Build order (decided)

1. **Type-and-speak composer — DONE (June 14 2026).** Added an "In your own words:" region to `index.html` (textarea + Speak + Clear), `ui.js` helpers (`onSpeakClick`/`onClearComposerClick`/`getComposerText`/`clearComposer`), and `handleSpeakComposed()` in `app.js` → `tts.speak()` in the selected voice. MVP behavior: speaks the composed text, guards empty/whitespace input, returns status to Listening/Ready. Works with whatever keyboard the OS offers (and a hardware keyboard in dev). This is the MVP realization of the free-composition invariant. **Deferred sub-decision (still open):** whether a spoken composed utterance should also be pushed into conversation history like a selected response (currently it is not). A "use system keyboard" affordance was not added (and must never be depended on for summoning the OS keyboard).
2. **In-app virtual keyboard (later).** A real renderer: on-screen keys sized for direct select, integrated with the app's look and the future access-method renderers.
3. **AI-assisted composition (later, after worldview lands).** Few-words → full-sentence expansion in the user's voice; personalized prediction.

Open sub-questions deferred to build time: where the composer sits relative to the move palette (screen allocation — already an open UI question), and whether the type-and-speak composer should also push the spoken utterance into conversation history like a selected response.

## Versioning

Format: **major.minor** (e.g., `0.1`, `0.2`). All pre-release versions use major `0`. The decision to increment to `1.0` or beyond is made jointly by Ken and Claude Code based on maturity and readiness.

**Release publishing is always public.** GitHub releases for this project are public by standing decision — Claude Code is authorized to push tags and publish releases publicly without pausing for confirmation. (Ken, June 2026.)

**Commit and push every completed step (current phase).** While Ken is the only person with access to the GitHub Pages deployment, Claude Code should **commit and push to `main` automatically as each step is completed** — no need to ask. This will change once beta testers are engaged: Ken will say so, and at that point we become more conservative about what is shared on GitHub Pages (commit locally, push deliberately). (Ken, June 14 2026.)

Phase-to-version mapping (update as releases are tagged):

| Version | Phase | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| 0.1     | 1     | Core conversation loop proof of concept |
| 0.2     | 1     | Continuous partner capture; persistent "Please repeat" control; auto-resume-listening setting |

## Open Questions (remaining)
- Response option UI layout: `UI-Design.docx` now specifies the four-region layout and move palette; remaining question is screen allocation between traditional AAC vocabulary and the AI-facilitated regions (composer-access region is the integration point; ultimately user-configurable per the Configuration Model)
- Worldview questionnaire: design complete and the five open decisions resolved (June 14 2026); **Build Step 1 (data model + registry) implemented and verified**. See the **Worldview Questionnaire (June 2026)** section. Next pick-up is Build Step 2 (questionnaire UI).
- Placeholder utterances: currently drawn randomly from a static JSON file (app/data/placeholders.json). Predictable fillers will become a joke to communication partners over time. LLM-generated contextual fillers would sound more natural and could acknowledge the topic, but must be evaluated against token cost impact. The architecture already supports user-funded API keys, so any added cost is borne by the user. *Design now specified:* the filler ladder in `Conversation-Engine-Design.docx` §6 (rung 1 static token ≤1 s, rung 2 static-or-contextual, rung 3 re-fill); contextual fillers are the rung-2 LLM option in the Configuration Model. Remaining work is implementation and the token-cost evaluation.
- TTS inflection: browser TTS has limited control (pitch, rate, volume on SpeechSynthesisUtterance). Natural-sounding placeholder delivery matters — monotone fillers will sound robotic. Voice banking / cloned voices (future) would give much better inflection control. Evaluate whether pitch/rate tweaks on fillers can improve naturalness in the near term.
