# Deferred work — the list

**This file exists because "it's on the list" was said when there was no list (Ken,
September 8 2026: *"It's statements like these that make me worried that things fall
through the cracks. Eliminating cracks is one of the things I rely on you to ensure!"*).**

That was worse than forgetting. Forgetting leaves the item visible to Ken; asserting a
mechanism that does not exist tells him the item is held somewhere and stops him tracking
it himself. **A deferral is not recorded until it is written down, and it is not reported
as recorded until it is in this file.**

## The rule

- **Never say "recorded", "on the list", "tracked", "noted" or "deferred" without naming
  where.** If it is not in a file, the honest sentence is *"I have not recorded this"* —
  then record it.
- **Write the entry BEFORE reporting it**, not after. The report is what Ken acts on.
- **A comment cleared from a document because it belongs elsewhere gets an entry here
  first.** `resolve-review.py` refuses to clear a comment without a stated disposition.
- **Deleting an entry is a decision**, so say which one and why: done, dropped, or
  superseded.

## What belongs here

Work that has been identified, is not being done now, and would otherwise live only in a
sentence somebody has to remember. **Not** a duplicate of things that already have a
home: a shipped decision belongs in `CLAUDE.md`, a released change in `CHANGELOG.md`, a
document's state in `DOC-SYNC.md`.

## Format

Each entry carries the date it was raised, where it came from, what is wanted, and why it
is not being done now — the last one because an item with no stated reason for waiting is
the one that quietly waits forever.

### The three User Manuals: the two backup files, and the profile rename
- **Raised:** 2026-09-09 — Ken, on the backup split: *"That behavior gets documented."*
- **Wanted:** all three manuals describe a single "Backup & transfer" section that no
  longer exists. They need: the section's new name, "Data and settings backup"; that data
  and settings are now two separate files and why (data goes to any device, settings only
  to one of the same shape); that a data backup is now named `conversant-data-…`; that
  both are written into the data folder where there is one and only leave by the save
  sheet where there is not; that a settings file carries every saved profile and which one
  is in use; that exporting offers to save unsaved changes into the current profile first;
  and — the one Ken named explicitly — **that importing a profile whose name you already
  use brings it in as "Ken iPad (2)" rather than replacing yours.**
- **Why not now:** the manuals are reader-facing and are synced at release by the standing
  process, and this cycle (0.10.13) has not shipped. Doing it now would date the documents
  ahead of the app. It is listed here because the rename in particular is behaviour a user
  will meet and cannot guess.

### Product Overview: the AI vendor's safety rules, and the distress case
- **Raised:** 2026-08-30 — CLAUDE.md, "A speech-to-speech model CANNOT be used here"
- **Wanted:** a paragraph beside *Not a Smart Speaker* saying the vendor's safety rules
  apply and cannot be switched off by the app, and that the app's own honesty rule is
  stricter and applies first.
- **Why not yet:** the paragraph about a user needing to say something bleak must NOT be
  written until the live-model testing below has actually been run — the honest position
  today is that it has not been measured.

### Test distress-shaped turns against the live model
- **Raised:** 2026-08-30 — CLAUDE.md, Open Questions
- **Wanted:** a dozen partner turns inviting a distressed reply, run against the real
  model, checking the cards are usable and in the user's voice rather than deflections.
  The measure is whether the user can SAY the thing.
- **Why not yet:** beta-gated. It also gates the Product Overview paragraph above.

### Tell an AI refusal apart from a network failure
- **Raised:** 2026-08-30 — CLAUDE.md, Open Questions
- **Wanted:** read the response's stop reason, log a refusal as its own kind of error, and
  count it in the weekly report. No user-facing error text — Ken's standing position.
- **Why not yet:** not seen in the field yet; it is instrumentation, not a defect.

### The 0.10.7 release note misstates the Express Panel grid
- **Raised:** 2026-09-08 — found while syncing the manuals
- **Wanted:** the note says "three rows of twelve rather than four rows of nine". The
  QWERTY default is three rows of ELEVEN, and the layout it replaced was 9/9/9/6.
- **Why not yet:** already published; correcting a shipped note is Ken's call, and the
  manuals were worded to be correct regardless.

## Done

### Sample conversations exercising the five modes together
- **Raised:** 2026-09-08 — Ken, as a comment on the Architecture Overview
- **Done:** 2026-09-08 — "What the Five Modes Look Like Together" in the Product
  Overview: two sample conversations, one social and one at a pharmacy counter, with the
  mode noted in brackets. The section exists to make one point — the user never selects a
  mode, they choose what to say and the system follows.

### Architecture Overview: the 0.10.6–0.10.9 sync
- **Raised:** 2026-09-08 — reverted when the document turned out to be under review
- **Done:** 2026-09-08 — synced once Ken cleared the review. Seven passages: the deferring
  option; repair-of-self corrected to four operations plus the guess flag; the placeholder
  ladder easing off; the honesty constraint, which the document had never carried; and the
  Health & Safety module with conversation-authored questions.

### The triple-coding rule, and the badges themselves
- **Raised:** 2026-09-08 — found while reviewing Ken's Architecture Overview corrections
- **Done:** 2026-09-08 — Ken's call was to eliminate the badges rather than reword around
  them: *"The badges are unnecessary and should be eliminated. If we ever extend the tool
  to support non-speaking blind individuals, we can reconsider but I don't see that ever
  happening."* Removed from `ui.js` (the accessible name is now the full wording alone),
  the dead CSS deleted, and the rule reworded in CLAUDE.md to position + colour with the
  reopening condition recorded. "My best guess" was kept — it is a warning about the
  words' provenance, not a category label. The Architecture Overview and Configuration
  Model were corrected; UI-Design already said "double-coded" and needed nothing.
