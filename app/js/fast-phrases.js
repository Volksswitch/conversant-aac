/* Fast Phrases — base-UI quick-speak sets (June 2026)
 *
 * Modeled on keyboard-layouts.js: phrase SETS encoded as data so the panel
 * renderer can switch between them and the chosen set is a user Setting. Per UI
 * Layout Rule 9 the fast-phrases panel is a BASE UI element (not a modal asset,
 * not an "In my own words" starter): each button SPEAKS its phrase directly,
 * shows the phrase as text (ellipsis-truncated when too long), and is exempt
 * from the icon-only rule (it's content, like a response card). Activation is
 * single- or double-tap per Rule 10.
 *
 * These are app-provided STARTER sets. Like the other user-owned configurable
 * sets (placeholders, openers, closers, keyboard layouts) the content becomes
 * user-editable later (its own editor + a data-folder JSON); this module is the
 * default seed and the selectable-set scaffold.
 *
 * WHY model on keyboard layouts — the keyguard-overlay reason (Ken, June 21
 * 2026): the panel must be GRID-CONGRUENT with a keyboard layout so a SINGLE
 * static keyguard overlays BOTH — fast-phrase buttons showing through the holes
 * at rest, and the compose-modal keyboard's keys showing through the SAME holes
 * during "In my own words" (Rule 8: the modal asset superimposes over the inert
 * base panel). So the panel sits where the keyboard will appear — same side
 * (the keyboard's left/right Setting), same grid — NOT opposite it.
 *
 * This module holds only the phrase CONTENT (the ordered sets). The GEOMETRY is
 * applied at render: the phrases fill the cells of the PAIRED keyboard layout's
 * grid 1:1 (one phrase per key-cell, ellipsis-truncated when long — Rule 9), so
 * the holes line up. Which keyboard layout a set pairs with is the binding, set
 * in the (held) base-layout pass; the content here is reusable across pairings.
 *
 * Phrase shape: { text, speak? } — `text` is shown AND spoken; optional `speak`
 * overrides only the spoken form (the display-vs-spoken / pronunciation model
 * recorded for proper nouns and static statements), falling back to `text`.

// Functional categories (Ken: color the phrases by category). Color is the
// SECONDARY cue — the phrase text is always shown — so this never violates the
// "no meaning by color alone" principle; it just groups at a glance. Hues are
// kept distinct from the four move-slot colors where practical (repair reuses
// purple deliberately — same concept).
export const CATEGORIES = {
  affirm: { label: 'Affirm / deny', color: '#00796B', tint: '#e0f2f1' }, // teal
  social: { label: 'Social',        color: '#3949AB', tint: '#e8eaf6' }, // indigo
  pace:   { label: 'Pace / turn',   color: '#E65100', tint: '#fff3e0' }, // deep orange
  repair: { label: 'Repair',        color: '#6A1B9A', tint: '#f3e5f5' }, // purple
  need:   { label: 'Needs',         color: '#AD1457', tint: '#fce4ec' }, // magenta
  back:   { label: 'Backchannel',   color: '#546E7A', tint: '#eceff1' }, // blue-grey
};

// Phrase builder: P('Yes','affirm') or P('Mom','social','Mom') for a distinct
// spoken form. `cat` keys into CATEGORIES for the button color.
const P = (text, cat = 'back', speak) => (speak ? { text, cat, speak } : { text, cat });

// ONE canonical list of quick phrases — always displayed in full, no
// user-selectable "sets" (Ken, June 21 2026: "we always display all possible
// quick phrases"). Ordered by likely frequency / utility so position is stable
// (motor automaticity) and a smaller keyguard grid still surfaces the most
// useful ones first; sized to fill a 5-wide layout's non-space cells (32). The
// list stays user-editable later (one list, no set picker).
