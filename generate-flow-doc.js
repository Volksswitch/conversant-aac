That forces the system to guess whether the partner has actually finished. Guess too early and the partner is cut off mid-utterance; wait longer to be safe and the user sits through avoidable delay on every turn."),

Recording stops only when the user chooses a response."),

The persistent “Please repeat what you said.” control is what makes this safe: when a capture is too garbled to work with, the user disposes of it outright rather than relying on automated cleanup.
