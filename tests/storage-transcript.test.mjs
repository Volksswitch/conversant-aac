/* Tier 2 — the REAL storage layer writing a REAL conversation file.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (Ken, August 21 2026). Every conversation-logging change here has
 * been signed off with the same caveat: "the on-disk write needs a granted data
 * folder, which the preview cannot produce." Ken pushed back on it — the folder was
 * never the obstacle. The File System Access API only hands a folder to the browser
 * through a native dialog nobody can click from automation, but that is not the only
 * way `storage.js` gets a root: with no folder picker present it adopts the
 * browser's own private filesystem instead, and that needs no gesture at all. That
 * is the iPad path, and it goes through exactly the same code.
 *
 * So the whole write path is exercised here: `startConversationLog`,
 * `logPartnerInterim`, `detachPendingPartnerTurn`, `finalizePartnerTurn` and the
 * flush, against a directory that behaves like the real thing. The file is then read
 * back and asserted — not the helper's return value, the bytes that were written.
 *
 * ⚠ THE POINT IS THE PARTS THE PURE TESTS CANNOT REACH: that a pending turn is
 * tracked across separate calls, that a flush writes valid JSON, that the private
 * conversation gate really does stop a write, and that the revision history survives
 * the round trip to storage rather than only existing in memory.
